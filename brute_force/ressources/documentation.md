using the script i try a list of possible usernames/passwords until a succussful login is found.

## prevention
- The first is to implement an account lockout policy.(after three failed login attempt block the account).
- Prevent automated submissions of the login page.using reCAPTCHA for example.
- Enforce the use of strong passwords. (mix letters and numbers, or requiring one special character, minimum 8 chars).
